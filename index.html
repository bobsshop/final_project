            <h1>The Mourning Dove:</h1>
            <p class="dove-info">Mourning doves (Zenaida Macroura) are small tree-nesting birds which live as far south
                as southern Mexico
                and
                as far north as the U.S./Canadian border and in some cases can be found in Central America and even the
                islands
                of the Caribbean. Mourning doves have gray/brown feathers on their backs typically with some dark spots
                on
                the
                wings and a bright blue ring around the eyes. Mourning doves are known for their smooth, cooing call
                which
                is said to sound mournful, which gives the birds their name. Their diet consists mainly of seeds, which
                they find by foraging. This makes
                them particularly vulnerable to being preyed upon by cats. They tend to nest in trees and shrubs and
                sometimes,
                even flower pots. The bird you see in the pictures to the left is a female sitting on a pair of eggs.
                This process is called brooding. Why do soon-to-be mother birds spend days or weeks brooding? She does
                it to incubate her eggs. When it comes to birds, the term incubate means to maintain the right
                conditions in the nest to favor the development and hatching of the eggs. So the soon-to-be mother bird
                sits on her eggs to keep them warm and to protect them from predators or any other kind of damage.
